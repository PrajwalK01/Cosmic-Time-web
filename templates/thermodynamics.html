        <p>
            While the laws of physics are mostly time-symmetric (they work the same forward and backward),
            <b>Entropy</b> provides a direction. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy
            (disorder) of an isolated system can never decrease over time. This gives time its "arrow."

        <h3>The Heat Death</h3>
        <p>
            If entropy continues to increase, the universe will eventually reach a state of maximum disorder and thermal
            equilibrium, known as the "Heat Death," where no more work can be extracted and time effectively ceases to
            have meaning.
