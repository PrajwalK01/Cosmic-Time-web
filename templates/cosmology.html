    <h2>1. Time Across Indian Cosmology</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            Indian cosmology describes time as <b>relative</b> and <b>cyclic</b>.
            A single day of Brahma (Kalpa) equals <b>4.32 billion human years</b>.
            This represents extreme scaling of time across reference frames, intuitively mirroring the concept of
            gravitational time dilation where time flows differently depending on the gravitational potential (or
            "loka").

    <h2>2. Linear vs Cyclic Time</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            <b>Greek Chronos</b> represents linear time (t), marching forward from a beginning to an end.
            <br>
            <b>Mayan and Indian systems</b> represent cyclic time, modeled mathematically as periodic functions like
            sine waves. In these models, "endings" are merely phase shifts into new cycles.
